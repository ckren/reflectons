change?

it helps to see what were the changes and we can apportion them so that they are one commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

branches are great if you want to test out experimental features or if you're making

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
it's easier to think about where things are and what branch is connected to what

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

it combines the two branches. this way we get to see the commits that created each branches

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
