How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me see that there were errors that could just arise out of typing improperly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will reduce the amount of time I spend looking for bugs and errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think when you manually commit, you get a chance to determine where you want your set point to be and you get to choose where to save. autosave leaves you at the mercy of google.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it lets you see how each file was at the time it was saved

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    it shows you all the commits and the diff function lets you see what has changed


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i wouldn't be afraid in case things are screwed up because i know that i can always go back and restore things to the way they were

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
